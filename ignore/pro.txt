now let's make changes to our next app by linking and making relevant api calls for each model using fasst API , also link our three forms to work with the api 
Add a background to the hero section it could either some animated svg or a simple gradient would do, 

also in the navbar can you make it so that if the user is logged in display the UserButton from clerk, 

also improve our CTA on the landing page
make use of the userButton at the Dashboard too,
 add fallback mechanisms that calculate and give a result in case our api fails
 add relevant console logs to ensure proper error tracking
