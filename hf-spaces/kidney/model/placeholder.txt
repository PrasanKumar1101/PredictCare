This directory will contain the kidney disease prediction model (kidney_model.pkl).
Place your trained scikit-learn model here.

Example code to load and use the model:
```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load model
with open("model/kidney_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Example prediction with preprocessed data
# This is a simplified example; actual data needs preprocessing as shown in app.py
sample_data = np.array([[
    48, 80, 1.020, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 121, 36, 1.2, 
    137.5, 4.5, 15.4, 44, 7800, 5.2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0
]])
result = model.predict_proba(sample_data)[0]
